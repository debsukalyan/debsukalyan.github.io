      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        My research aims to understand how emotion, reward, and expectation shape cognitive control. I combine behavioural experiments, eye-tracking, neuroimaging,
        and computational modelling to examine how proactive control mechanisms resolve affective interference in the brain and behaviour.

          <h3>Reward &amp; Emotional Conflict</h3>
          <p>Examining how reward motivation can modulate emotional conflict in the brain and behaviour.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Paradigm:</strong> An emotional conflict task is preceded by reward vs. no‑reward cues. Participants (n&nbsp;≈&nbsp;40) identify facial expressions (happy/fear) while ignoring incongruent emotion words.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurements:</strong> Behaviour (accuracy, reaction time) and 3T fMRI were recorded to capture both behavioural performance and neural activation patterns during conflict resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Multivariate pattern analysis (linear SVM) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) were applied to fMRI data; behavioural conflict costs were compared across reward vs. no‑reward blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Reward cues attenuated conflict costs and increased preparatory activation in fronto‑striatal and limbic regions (ACC, ventral striatum), highlighting motivation‑driven proactive control.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Expectancy &amp; Proactive Control</h3>
          <p>Investigating how informative cues about upcoming trials shape preparatory control of emotional conflict.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Paradigm:</strong> Symbolic cues predict whether the upcoming trial will be congruent or incongruent. Two cohorts perform the emotional conflict task while expecting conflict or non‑conflict trials.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurements:</strong> Behavioural accuracy and reaction times are complemented by eye‑tracking metrics (pupil dilation and saccadic latency) using a Gazepoint&nbsp;GP3 system to capture preparatory adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Behavioural and oculometric data are compared across valid vs. invalid expectancy cues to quantify proactive control. Pupillometry and gaze patterns reveal anticipatory adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Informative cues reduce conflict costs and elicit early gaze shifts and pupil dilation, indicating that predictive information enables strategic up‑regulation of attention.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Uncertainty &amp; Cognitive Control</h3>
          <p>Probing how unpredictability in reward structure influences control allocation and decision dynamics.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Paradigm:</strong> Modified conflict tasks systematically vary reward probability and outcome variance, producing blocks with high vs. low uncertainty about whether a correct response will be rewarded.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurements:</strong> Reaction times and accuracy across participants are fitted with hierarchical drift diffusion models (HDDM) to estimate latent parameters such as drift rate and boundary separation.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Model‑based comparisons of high‑ and low‑uncertainty blocks reveal how uncertainty modulates evidence accumulation (drift) and caution (threshold). Behavioural conflict costs are assessed across conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> High uncertainty triggers more conservative decision thresholds and slower evidence accumulation, implying that unpredictability of rewards acts as a motivational signal for cognitive control.</li>
