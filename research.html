      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        My research aims to understand how emotion, reward, and expectation shape cognitive control. I combine behavioural experiments, eye-tracking, neuroimaging,
        and computational modelling to examine how proactive control mechanisms resolve affective interference in the brain and behaviour.

          <h3>Reward &amp; Emotional Conflict</h3>
          <p>
            This project investigates how reward motivation modulates the resolution of emotional conflict. Participants perform an emotional conflict task
            where each trial begins with a cue indicating the possibility of a monetary reward or no reward. The task phase requires identifying facial expressions
            while ignoring incongruent word cues. We collected behavioural responses and fMRI data from 39 healthy adults. Analyses using multivariate pattern
            analysis (MVPA) with linear support vector machines and representational similarity analysis (RSA) reveal that reward cues enhance proactive control,
            reducing reaction time costs and increasing activation in fronto-striatal and limbic regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum.

          <h3>Expectancy &amp; Proactive Control</h3>
          <p>
            Here we explore how informative cues about upcoming stimuli shape cognitive control of emotional conflict. Participants complete tasks in which
            cue symbols indicate whether the forthcoming trial will be congruent or incongruent. Across two behavioural cohorts, we measure accuracy, reaction time,
            and eye-tracking metrics such as pupil dilation and saccade patterns. Valid expectancy cues facilitate proactive control, as reflected in reduced
            conflict costs and anticipatory adjustments in gaze behaviour. These findings highlight the role of expectation in preparing neural systems to filter
            emotional interference.

          <h3>Uncertainty &amp; Cognitive Control</h3>
          <p>
            Unpredictability can act as a motivational signal. In this line of work, we probe how variability in reward magnitude and probability influences
            cognitive control allocation. Participants perform tasks where reward probability and outcome variance are manipulated across blocks, creating conditions
            of high and low uncertainty. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling (HDDM) of response times and accuracy indicates that high uncertainty evokes
            more cautious decision strategies and shifts in decision dynamics. These results reveal how unpredictability in the reward structure shapes
            proactive control mechanisms.
