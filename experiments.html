        These interactive tasks allow you to experience classic cognitive phenomena first‑hand. Each game is inspired by paradigms used in psychological
        and neuroscience research, measuring aspects of attention, memory, decision‑making and flexibility. Click <em>Play</em> to try them yourself!

        <!-- Colour Stroop Test -->
        <div class="experiment-card">
          <h3>Colour Stroop Test</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> Stroop Effect. Name the colour of each word while ignoring its meaning. Congruent trials (word and colour match)
            compete with incongruent trials (word and colour mismatch), revealing interference.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> View colour words printed in coloured ink. Click the button corresponding to the ink colour, not the word itself. Your
            reaction time and accuracy across congruent and incongruent trials are measured.

        <!-- Emotional Conflict Task -->
        <div class="experiment-card">
          <h3>Emotional Conflict Task</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> Emotional Conflict. Identify the facial expression while ignoring an overlaid emotion word. Congruent trials (word and expression match)
            are compared to incongruent trials to measure conflict resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> You will see a face with an emotional word written across it. Decide whether the facial expression is happy or sad by pressing
            the corresponding key. Ignore the word and focus on the face. Reaction time and accuracy reveal how emotions compete for attention.

          <h3>Colour Stroop Memory Match</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> Stroop Effect + Working Memory. Remember both the word and its display colour despite interference.
          </p>
            <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> First, memorize six colour words displayed in various ink colours. After a 3‑second delay, you will be shown two cards.
            Click the one that matches the exact word‑colour combination you just saw. Twenty rounds track your accuracy and reaction times on congruent vs. incongruent matches.

          <h3>Number Sequence Detective</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> 2‑Back Working Memory. Monitor a stream of numbers and detect when the current number matches the one shown two steps before.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> Numbers (1–9) appear one at a time. Press <em>Yes</em> if the current number is the same as the number two positions back; press <em>No</em>
            otherwise. For example: 5 → 3 → 5 (press Yes on the second 5). Thirty rounds assess your hits, misses and response times.

            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> Mental Rotation. Mentally rotate objects to identify if they match a target shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> A target shape appears on the left and two comparison shapes on the right. One is the same shape rotated; the other is a mirror image.
            Click the shape that matches the target. Twenty‑five trials compare your accuracy and speed at different rotation angles.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> A category (Animals, Colours or Fruits) appears. Word bubbles float upward — click only those belonging to the category within
            30 seconds. Each correct pop earns 10 points; incorrect pops lose 5 points. Three rounds test your accuracy and focus.

          <h3>Speed Sorter Pro</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Task:</strong> Task Switching / Cognitive Flexibility. Quickly switch between sorting rules based on colour or number.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to Play:</strong> Cards display coloured numbers (e.g., red 7, blue 3). A rule appears at the top: “SORT BY NUMBER” or “SORT BY COLOUR”.
            For the number rule: click left for odd numbers and right for even numbers. For the colour rule: click left for warm colours (red/orange) and right for cool
            colours (blue/green). Rules change frequently — track how your reaction times differ on rule changes versus repetitions across 40 rounds.
